To prepare university graduates for future employment, many university courses require students to work on team projects. This helps the students develop important lifelong skills, such as teamwork, cooperation and delegation of work. A common issue that arises in this situation is teams of students who are not compatible. Some contributing factors are skill set, personalities and work habits. To help address the problem and make more compatible teams, a system called the Carleton University Project Identifier (cuPID) was proposed to be developed. For a given project, the cuPID system would organize students into compatible teams using a qulitative based unique Project Partner IDentifier (PPID) algorithm.
